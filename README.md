CCCP
=======

This is a repository implementing CCCP algortihm.

Run `data.R` on simulated data.

`lasso.cd`: Lasso with Coordinate Descent
`lasso.cd.cccp`: Algorithm from *Calibrating nonconvex penalized regression in ultra-high dimension*
`lasso.cd.ncv`: Algorithm from *Coordinate descent algorithms for nonconvex penalized regression, with applications to biological feature selection*

`HBIC`: For a CCCP estimation, calculate `HBIC`, `MSE`, `SCAD`, `TP`, `FP` on a sequence of `lambda`.
